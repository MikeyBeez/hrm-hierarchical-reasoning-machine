# Code of Conduct

## ðŸ§  HRM Community Principles

The HRM (Hierarchical Reasoning Machine) project is dedicated to advancing AI reasoning research through open collaboration. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all.

## Our Standards

**Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:**

* **Collaborative Reasoning**: Sharing insights, questioning assumptions constructively, and building on each other's ideas
* **Research Excellence**: Prioritizing accuracy, reproducibility, and scientific rigor
* **Inclusive Innovation**: Welcoming diverse perspectives and approaches to reasoning system design
* **Constructive Feedback**: Providing specific, actionable feedback on code, algorithms, and ideas
* **Knowledge Sharing**: Documenting discoveries and helping others understand complex concepts

**Examples of unacceptable behavior include:**

* Personal attacks, harassment, or discriminatory language
* Publishing private information without permission  
* Spam, trolling, or off-topic disruptions
* Plagiarism or failure to properly attribute work
* Deliberately introducing malicious code or misleading information

## Enforcement

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. They have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.0.

## HRM-Specific Guidelines

**For Research Contributions:**
- Always provide clear documentation and examples
- Include performance benchmarks when proposing optimizations
- Explain the reasoning behind architectural decisions
- Test across multiple complexity levels (Simple, Medium, Complex, Expert)

**For Code Contributions:**
- Follow the modular architecture patterns established in Phases 4-5
- Include comprehensive tests for new functionality
- Maintain compatibility with the MCP integration framework
- Document any new convergence detection strategies

**For Community Engagement:**
- Help newcomers understand the hierarchical reasoning concepts
- Share interesting use cases and applications
- Collaborate on research papers and publications
- Participate in performance benchmarking efforts
