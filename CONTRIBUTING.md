## üéØ Priority Issues for New Contributors

### Issue #1: Automated Execution Engine (Critical)
**Impact**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Makes HRM actually usable)
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Skills**: Python async, workflow orchestration
**Files**: `src/hrm_core.py`, `src/mcp_integration.py`

Currently, executing an HRM pattern requires manual function calls. We need:
```python
# Current (manual):
analysis = hrm.analyze_query(query)
results = await mcp.execute_pattern(analysis['pattern'], query)

# Needed (automated):
result = await hrm.execute(query)  # Does everything automatically
```

### Issue #2: Real Convergence Detection (Critical)
**Impact**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Optimizes reasoning quality)
**Difficulty**: Hard
**Skills**: NLP, ML, statistical analysis
**Files**: `src/hrm_core.py` (ConvergenceDetector class)

Currently uses simple heuristics. Need intelligent analysis of tool outputs:
- Semantic similarity between iterations
- Information novelty detection
- Confidence trend analysis
- Content quality assessment

### Issue #3: Error Handling (High Priority)
**Impact**: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Production readiness)
**Difficulty**: Medium
**Skills**: Exception handling, system reliability
**Files**: `src/mcp_integration.py`

Add comprehensive error handling:
- Tool failure detection and retry logic
- Fallback strategies (alternative tools)
- Graceful degradation when tools unavailable
- Error logging and recovery
