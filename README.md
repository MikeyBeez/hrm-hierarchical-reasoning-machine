## Overview

The Hierarchical Reasoning Machine (HRM) is an AI reasoning system that mimics human cognitive patterns by alternating between high-level conceptual thinking and low-level detailed analysis. Built using Claude's Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration, HRM adapts its reasoning complexity based on query difficulty and orchestrates multiple AI tools in intelligent hierarchical patterns.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Adaptive Complexity Assessment**: Automatically classifies queries into Simple, Medium, Complex, or Expert levels
- **Hierarchical Reasoning Patterns**: Executes H-L-H (High-Low-High) reasoning sequences
- **Real MCP Tool Integration**: Orchestrates brain memory, web search, sequential thinking, and reasoning tools
- **Convergence Detection**: Optimizes iteration cycles by detecting when sufficient reasoning is achieved
- **Cross-Session Learning**: Maintains context and learns from previous reasoning patterns
- **Self-Reflective Analysis**: Provides transparent reasoning chains similar to DeepSeek models

## 🔄 Reasoning Patterns

### Simple Pattern (H)
```
Query → brain_recall → Result
```
*For basic queries requiring single knowledge retrieval*

### Medium Pattern (H-L-H)  
```
Query → brain_recall → web_search → brain_remember → Result
```
*For comparative analysis and evaluation tasks*

### Complex Pattern (H-L-H-L-H)
```
Query → brain_recall → sequential_thinking → web_search → reasoning_tools → brain_remember → Result
```
*For multi-step system design and analysis*

### Expert Pattern (H-L-H-L-H-H)
```
Query → brain_recall → sequential_thinking → web_search → reasoning_tools → sequential_thinking → brain_remember → Result
```
*For breakthrough-level analysis and research synthesis*

## 📊 Performance Results
