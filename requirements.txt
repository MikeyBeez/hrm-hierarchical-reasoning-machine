# Hierarchical Reasoning Machine (HRM) Requirements
# =================================================
# These dependencies would be needed for a complete implementation

# Core Python packages for data processing
numpy>=1.21.0
pandas>=1.3.0

# Async processing for MCP tool orchestration
asyncio-mqtt>=0.11.0
aiohttp>=3.8.0

# Natural language processing for complexity assessment
regex>=2022.1.18
nltk>=3.7

# Data structures and utilities
dataclasses-json>=0.5.7
typing-extensions>=4.0.0

# Development and testing
pytest>=7.0.0
pytest-asyncio>=0.21.0
black>=22.0.0
mypy>=0.950

# Documentation
sphinx>=4.5.0
sphinx-rtd-theme>=1.0.0

# Optional: Machine learning for advanced pattern recognition
# scikit-learn>=1.1.0
# torch>=1.12.0  # For neural complexity assessment

# Note: This is a proof-of-concept implementation (40% complete)
# Full implementation would require:
# 1. Automated execution engine
# 2. Real-time convergence detection
# 3. Error handling and retry mechanisms
# 4. Adaptive pattern learning algorithms
